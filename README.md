# Introduction

Let's get a pulse one where your coding skills are! We'd like you to build a small mobile app using React Native that we can run and review to get a feel for your code. We'll probably have some questions for you about it when you get to the technical dev interview portion of the interivew process so be ready to talk about your work and your coding decisions.

## Requirements

Build an application using React Native. This application will have two pages. 

### Page One

One page will provide a number input that accepts a monetary amount in cents (`1000 = $10.00`) and displays that number formatted according to a selected currency.

### Page Two

Page two will provide three inputs.

How you navigate in between these screens and the overall visual design of this application is entirely up to you so go crazy!  But, a simple UI is totally fine.

All the architecture and tooling is entirely up to you as well. Code in an enviroment that makes you most comfortable!

1. A picker type input that supports the values USD, GPB, and JPY which represents the selected currency.
2. A switch input the represents whether or not to display the cents portion of the output (the `.00` in `$10.00`).
3. A switch input that represents whether or not a separator character (the `,` in `$1,000.00`) is displayed in formated number output.

## What we're looking for

- Production quality code.  Treat this like it's a shippable product that'll live on forever and have other developers contributing to the project.
- Use of React hooks and/or custom React hooks.
- A completed project that's easy for us to run on simulators, play with, and review.

Feel free to add as much or as little to this project as you see fit within a reasonable amount of time.  We'll never be mad at going the extra mile as long as the requrements are met.
